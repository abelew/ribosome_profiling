Ribo-Seq ORF detection
======================

Overview
--------

STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT

The purpose of this project is to provide some simple scripts for detecting
unannotated ORFs from ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) data.

The basic approach is XXXXXX.

@Trey -- it's up to you if you want to make this comprehensive (from raw data
to results), or just refer to your earlier work... The later would be less
work, but would make the script less useful to people outside of our lab. The
former could mean pulling a lot of your earlier work, and is perhaps too much
trouble. It's up to you. Perhaps an ideal (but most time-demanding) would be to
put together a small ribosome profiling analysis library which could be used
across multiple organisms, and may be more generally useful to people getting
started with the analysis in other labs...

Requirements
------------

This script(s) assumes that you have the following:

- An annotated reference genome (FASTA + GFF)
- Ribosome profiling data is XXX format
- Python XX
- BioPython YY
